For this assignment, I was able to get the current weather and the 5 day forecast to show up. The API for the daily forecast on OpenWeather is not part of the free subscription, so I have to use the 5 day hourly API and set it to the date and time for the remiander of the week. 

Here is the API I used: api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={API key}


I still can't seem to get the localStorage right or get the saved searches of the cities to stay in the first card on the left. I have the code for it in my script file but it's not working.

I also fetched the UV Index API but I also can't seem to get it to show up. I also included the code for it in my script file.
